## Screen 1: Landing / Entrance

```
A minimal landing page with only a name "George Drag" centered on the screen.
Light off-white background (#fafafa). The name is large display typography
(72-96px), near-black (#1a1a1a), styled like a hyperlink with subtle underline
on hover. Late 1960s/70s Swiss graphic design aesthetic. Massimo Vignelli
inspired. Generous whitespace. Nothing else on the page — just the name.
```

## Screen 2: Main Experience (Post-Click)

```
Full-bleed photography covering the entire viewport. A confident headline
floats on top of the image in white text with subtle shadow for legibility.
Late 60s/70s editorial style like Harper's Bazaar or Richard Avedon.
Typography is bold, large (48-64px), positioned asymmetrically. Light, airy
feel. No navigation bar. Scroll indicator at bottom (subtle).

GitHub commit info (last commit message, date). Cards have generous spacing
(48px gaps). Swiss grid layout, asymmetric positioning. Late 60s/70s
editorial aesthetic. No dark mode. Clean, confident typography.
