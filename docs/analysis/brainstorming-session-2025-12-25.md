# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** George
**Date:** 2025-12-25

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Living Portfolio Website (georgedrag.ai)

A dynamic, auto-updating developer portfolio that:
- Integrates with GitHub to show real-time project status
- Uses AI to generate visual content
- Showcases ~4 prototype projects (and growing)
- Links to live apps (App Store, deployed URLs, versions)
- Includes music projects for multi-dimensional creative identity
- Serves as a "living resume" for job differentiation

**Goals:** Define the visual/UX concept that makes this feel premium and unique — not boring LinkedIn, but stylish and tasteful.

### Context Guidance

Focus areas: User Experience, Market Differentiation, Visual Identity

### Session Setup

George wants to build a personal brand website at georgedrag.ai that functions as a living, breathing portfolio. The key insight is that this is "GitHub meets Dribbble meets LinkedIn" but personal — showing projects alive and evolving, not just listed.

Primary session focus: Visual/UX concept development.

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Identity-driven visual design — authentic self-expression over audience optimization

**Recommended Techniques:**
1. **Values Archaeology** — Excavate George's aesthetic DNA and core visual principles
2. **Cross-Pollination** — Draw inspiration from admired sites/brands, synthesize uniquely
3. **Dream Fusion Laboratory** — Fantasy version with no constraints, then extract essentials

---

## Phase 1: Values Archaeology

### Excavation Results

| Principle | George's Position |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Palette** | Light — bright, airy, not moody |
| **Density** | Spacious — breathing room, let things land |
| **Philosophy** | "Artistic simplicity" — max UX from min visual elements |
| **Motion** | Subtle physics — things have weight, respond gently, feel alive |
| **Anti-patterns** | Corporate bland, overly cute, cluttered, sterile |
| **Vibe Word** | **"Art"** |

### Design Era Reference

**Late 60s / Early 70s Graphic Design** — the golden era:
- Typography: Helvetica, Futura, confident and BIG — type as design element
- Grid Systems: Swiss precision, used expressively
- Whitespace: Generous, intentional
- Color: Bold but restrained — 2-3 colors max
- Photography: Treated as graphic element
- Layout: Asymmetric but balanced, editorial confidence
- Overall: Timeless — would look good in 1972 AND 2025

**Reference Designers:** Massimo Vignelli, Paul Rand, Saul Bass

### Core Identity Statement

```
GEORGE'S VISUAL IDENTITY
========================
Light + Spacious + Classic Editorial
Minimalism with SOUL, not sterility
Subtle physics (tactile, weighted, alive)
Late 60s/70s graphic design sensibility
Confident typography, restrained palette
One word: ART
```

---

## Phase 2: Cross-Pollination

### Core Visual Concept — Locked In

**Richard Avedon / Harper's Bazaar Editorial Style**
- Full-bleed photography — George's OWN photos from his camera roll
- Confident typography floating on top of images
- The image IS the design, text floats confidently
- Dynamic: syncs from Apple Photos, evolves as George evolves

### Why This Works

| What His Photos Show | What It Communicates |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| His compositional eye | "This person sees the world differently" |
| His subjects & interests | "This is what they care about" |
| His editing style | "This is their aesthetic signature" |
| The fact they're HIS | "This isn't stock. This is real." |

### Technical Approach (Feasible)

1. Dedicated Apple Photos album ("Website Backgrounds")
2. iOS Shortcuts auto-sync to cloud folder (Dropbox/S3)
3. Site pulls from that folder — new photo = new background option

---

## Phase 3: Dream Fusion Laboratory

### The Fantasy Vision

| Element | George's Vision |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Entrance** | Just his name. Nothing else. Bold simplicity. Engagement required to proceed. |
| **Scroll/Motion** | TBD — subtle, simple, possibly with an "old" aesthetic quality |
| **Projects** | Practical for developers — GitHub commits, commit messages, code-review style. Functional, not arty. |
| **Music** | Bandcamp integration — songs with blurbs via embeds or light scraping |
| **Magic Moment** | N/A — only needs to look cool to George himself |

### The Key Duality

The site operates in **two modes**:

| Layer | Vibe |
|-------|------|
| **The Canvas** | Art. Personal photos. Editorial. Avedon. Full-bleed. Beautiful. |
| **The Content** | Practical. GitHub commits. Code review. Devs get what they need. |

**Art wrapping substance.** Looks like a gallery, functions like a dev portfolio.

---

## Session Synthesis

### Project: georgedrag.ai

**One-Line Vision:** A living, editorial-style portfolio that uses George's own photography as the canvas, with coding projects presented practically for developers — art wrapping substance.

### Core Design Principles

1. **Light + Spacious** — Airy, breathing room, not cramped
2. **Artistic Simplicity** — Maximum UX from minimum visual elements
3. **Subtle Physics** — Tactile, weighted motion that feels alive
4. **Late 60s/70s Editorial** — Vignelli, Avedon, Harper's Bazaar energy
5. **Authentic Self-Expression** — It should feel like George, not impress others

### Visual Language

- **Background:** Full-bleed personal photography synced from Apple Photos
- **Typography:** Confident, bold, floating over images
- **Color:** Restrained palette (2-3 colors max)
- **Motion:** Subtle, physics-based, never gratuitous
- **Layout:** Asymmetric but balanced, editorial confidence

### Functional Elements

| Element | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Homepage** | Just his name. Minimal. Engagement required. |
| **Photography** | Auto-syncs from dedicated Apple Photos album |
| **Coding Projects** | GitHub integration — commits, messages, versions |
| **Music Projects** | Bandcamp embeds with blurbs |
| **Overall** | Living document that evolves as George evolves |

### Technical Considerations

- Apple Photos → Cloud sync (iOS Shortcuts + Dropbox/S3)
- GitHub API for project data and commit history
- Bandcamp embeds (no official API, embeds are cleaner)
- Vercel or similar for deployment
- Subtle physics via CSS/JS (Framer Motion, etc.)

### Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)

- Corporate bland
- Overly cute
- Cluttered chaos
- Sterile minimalism (minimalism yes, sterile no)
- Dark mode terminals / typical dev portfolio vibes

## Next Steps

This brainstorming output feeds into:
1. **Product Brief** — Formal vision document (PM agent)
2. **PRD** — Detailed requirements
3. **Architecture** — Technical design
4. **Epics & Stories** — Implementation plan
